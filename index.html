      <p class = "about"> Hi! I'm Alicia Iott. I study Fine Arts and Computer Scientist at Carnegie Mellon. I've been working on a few different projects involving augmented reality, Hololens, Kinect, and finger-detecing with computer vision. Check out my sidebar to read more about those projects.</p>

      <p class = "about"><i>About my work:</i></p>

      <p class = "about">As an artist, I am inspired by the relationship between the "truth" and what is subjective, between virtual and physical, between reality and memory. We define ourselves as individuals using our sensory relationship to the world and our experiences (or at least what we remember of them). My work seeks to question our perception of "realness" and tugs at the boundary between tangible and intangible. This is why I find virtual and augmented reality so fascinating.
