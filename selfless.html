            <p class = "about">Selfless was an installation piece created after much research on the ability of humans to self identify. This is a trait that separates us from any other animal. Not even primates can reliably recognize themselves in mirrors. I was fascinated by the evolutionary purpose behind knowing what we look like.</p>
            
            <p class = "about">Humans intuitively expect to see their reflection in a mirror; when viewing this piece they cannot see their reflection rendering them selfless if only for an instant.
