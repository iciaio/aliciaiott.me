	<h1>Interactive Rotoscope 2017</h1>
	<p>An rotoscoped subject who's position can be controlled by user input. Go ahead and click and drag on the drawing below!</p>
	<p class="about">I filmed a friend as he spun around and drew over the photographs to create a time-based, rotoscoped film with the scanned drawings. I used OpenFrameworks and p5 to allow a viewer to click and drag to switch between frames. The result is that the user can "spin" the subject sort of as if he were in a virtual 3d space.</p>
	<p>A signifiant motivation behind this project was to imbue an interactive, digital experience with a handmade quality.</p>
