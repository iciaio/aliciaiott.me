          I was the artist in a team of 5 who worked on this game. For the most part, I worked on the aesthetic (wood desktop/dashboard, manila envelopes, old mug shots, etc, books as instructions...) but I also suggested the coffee cup as the "hint" mechanism as it parallels a caffeine rush and I suggested the pins as a way to imply the permanence of tiles. This game was a lot of fun for me because I enjoyed working with noir topics.
