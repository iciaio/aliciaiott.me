	<p class="about">A random, generative animation and series of drawings illustrating a continuum between disorder and order.</p>
	    
	<p>This project was completed for a computational art class at CMU taught by Golan Levin. The animation was created in Processing with a series of bezier curves with (somewhat*) randomly chosen parameters. *I use a gaussian distribution to ensure that during the disorderly period, there is a lot of overlap in the lines. With time, the magnitude of the variables increase or decrease. To create a series of drawings, I grabbed nine of the generated frames and plotted them with the Axidraw.</p>
