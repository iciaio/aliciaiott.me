	<h1>Chomp 2016</h1>
	<p class="about">A fun, whimsical video game controlled by a player's mouth.</p>
	<p>I used FaceOSC and Processing to create this game. The premise: There was an explosion at the Tasty Carbâ„¢ factory! Food and debris are falling everywhere. Players use their face as a controller, chomping down on virtual foods to gain points. Eating too many limbs will end the game while yummy snacks increase the score. The grotesque, cartoonish visuals were inspired by a capitalist's ravenous appetite for all things terrible. </p>
