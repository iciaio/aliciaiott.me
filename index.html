      <p class = "about"> Hi! I'm Alicia Iott. I study Fine Arts and Computer Scientist at Carnegie Mellon. I've been working on a few different projects involving augmented reality, Hololens, Kinect, and finger-detecing with computer vision. Check out my sidebar to read more about those projects.</p>

<p class = "about"><i>Artist Statement:</i></p>

<p class = "about">I strive to create experiences that straddle the boundary between surreal and real, that falls somewhere in the uncanny valley. As an artist I hope to evoke from my viewers feelings of detachment, memory, depersonalization, and disorientation.
