      <p class = "about"> Hi! I'm Alicia Iott. I study Fine Arts and Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon. I've been working on a few different projects involving augmented reality, Hololens, Kinect, and finger-detecing with computer vision. Check out my sidebar to read more about those projects.</p>

      <p class = "about"><i>About my work:</i></p>

      <p class = "about">I create web apps, mobile apps, video games, and virtual and augmented experiences using software and code. Conceptually, I am interested in alternate realities that are superimposed upon everyday life. Whenever we disengage from the present moment whether by scrolling through news feeds, reading a book, watching a movie, daydreaming, or remembering past events, we participate in a personal alternative reality. Within my art, I try to analyze the ways we participate in our own realities, the ways we can bring those personal headspaces outwards to share, and how the evolution of technology has shaped the way people experience subjective moments. Because of my interest in the way subjective experience differs from “truth” as well as how people define themselves using their subjective experiences, I have worked to explore and catalogue my own fallible, incomplete memories.
