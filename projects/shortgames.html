	<h1>Short Games (2015)</h1>
	<p class="about">These were games created in a game design course taught by Tom Corbett at CMU. I collaborated with Mackenzie Bates, Anton Pleshakov, Greg Rose, Sarah Chen, Daniel Kim to create these games. My roles included asset creation, interaction planning, storyboarding, and experience design.</p>
	<p><i>Little Red in the Hood</i></p>
	<p>This was a sin city inspired 2.5D stealth game based loosely off of the little red riding hood fairy tale. The player controls Little Red, a drug dealer for her trap queen grandmother. The goal is to avoid being seen by the police while completing drop-offs. My main role in this project was planning the virtual city and creating assets (buildings/cars/lights/traffic cones/etc.) for it.</p>

	<p><i>Rightfully Accused (Cluedoku)</i></p>
	<p>A loose rebranding of sudoku such that each row and column need to contain a villian, and location, a weapon, and a victim which tell the story of a crime commited. The layout is inspired by a film noir detective's desk. The player solves crimes by completing the puzzle. I took the artistic lead on this project and made most of the assets.</p>
