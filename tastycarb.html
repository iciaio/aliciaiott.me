          <p class = "about">
          This is an video game controlled by the player's mouth. I used FaceOSC and Processing. There was an explosion at the Tasty Carbâ„¢ factory! Food and debris are falling everywhere. Players use their face as a controller, chomping down on virtual foods to gain points. Eating too many limbs will end the game while yummy snacks increase the score. The grotesque, cartoonish visuals were inspired by people's ravenous appetite for all things terrible.
