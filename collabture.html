          <p class = "about">
          A speculative design and a mobile app, Collabure explores the idea of crowd-sourced recording and public memory. What if the copious amounts of footage that people record with their smartphones at certain events (concerts, rap freestyles, school yard fights, car accidents, etc) could be used to reconstruct the scene in 3 dimensions? Participants could relive those moments and outsiders could experience informal events immersively for the first time.
