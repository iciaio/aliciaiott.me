<div class="from-me">
	<p>Are you a trump supporter?</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-them"><p>
Yep</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-them"><p>
Did I just get hotter?</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-them"><p>
I guess you're just speechless</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-them"><p>
It happens</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-them"><p>
So like you can't talk to someone who voted for trump?</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-me"><p>Of course I can</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-me"><p>I just don't really want to</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-them"><p>
Growing up is hard for some people</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-me"><p>It's important for me to be with people who share my political views</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-them"><p>
I'm a proponent of a diversity of opinions and believe that surrounding myself with sycophants is unhealthy to intellectual growth.</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-them"><p>
But you do you.</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-me"><p>I'm from the south, I've been around enough white male trump supports for a lifetime</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-them"><p>
By white male you mean racist/sexist/bigots</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-me"><p>Well I think all people have inherent racial and gender biases</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-me"><p>We all operate with stereotypes in mind</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-me"><p>It just so happened that white men usually benefit from those stereotypes</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-me"><p>So it is least likely for them to be interested in change</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-them"><p>
All people suffer from stereotypes but we just blame white males- got it</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-me"><p>I actually said &quot;It just so happened that white men usually benefit from those stereotypes So it is least likely for them to be interested in change &quot;</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-them"><p>
That's a terrible stereotype</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-them"><p>
Against white males.</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-them"><p>
The least likely?</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-me"><p>You're interested in social reform and affirmative action and social welfare programs like social security and Medicaid?</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-me"><p>You care about trans and queer rights?</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-them"><p>
Trans queer rights are not on the top of my agenda</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-them"><p>
Or Americas agenda</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-me"><p>You advocate for a 50% female congress? And for equal pay in the workplace and paid leave for new mothers and fathers?</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-them"><p>
I don't think you understand affirmative action and what is legal.</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-me"><p>So what do you want? What do you think trump will do to improve America?</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-me"><p>That's presumptuous</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-them"><p>
Well quotas aren't legal. The Supreme Court ruled on that in the 90's I believe at university of Michigan</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-me"><p>Legality doesn't equate to morality</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-me"><p>Or even equality for that matter</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-them"><p>
I believe America can change back into a producer/creator of wealth. I believe trump will disrupt the military industrial complex and destroy the banking cartel that had put Washington in the pocket of Wall Street for decades.</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-me"><p>How?</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-them"><p>
Clinton/bush dynasties were both neocon war monger if machines that left millions dead across the planet and with Americans in debt for endless wars.</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-them"><p>
People voted for trump because 95 million working age adults do not currently work.</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-them"><p>
And as great as trans queer rights sound- people want to work and feed their families</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-me"><p>Trump took advantage of the subprime mortgage crisis for financial gain I don't believe he has any interest in elevating the working/lower class</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-them"><p>
Real incomes haven't increased since the seventies</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-them"><p>
Explain the subprime mortgage crisis to me please</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-me"><p>If you can't empathize with marginalized people (lower income, brown, female, gay, trans, impoverished) how can you hope to improve their situation</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-them"><p>
Saying you want to improve their economic conditions isn't empathy?</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-me"><p>The subprime mortgage crisis was when banks gave mortgages to people who couldn't affect them, bundled those mortgages and sold them to investors</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-me"><p>They were conning the American taxpayer, they were so big that the government would have to bail them out</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-me"><p>The improvement of economic conditions is absolutely paramount</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-me"><p>And it begins with education and creating a level playing field for impoverished and disenfranchised Americans</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-them"><p>
You just basically said you win a baseball game by scoring a touchdown field homerun</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-me"><p>Instead of insulting my phrasing, why don't you productively correct me.</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-them"><p>
Look. I get it. Your a young student enchanted by left wing ideals. It's great. It's good that you're passionate about something other than the kardashians.</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-me"><p>(Politely preferably)</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-me"><p>You're super mad right now so I think we should stop talking</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-me"><p>You're* also</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-them"><p>
I'm not super mad. I'm quite calm. I know I'm not going to convince you on anything. Which again is fine.</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-them"><p>
We don't see eye to eye on much</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-them"><p>
But that's fine.</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-them"><p>
America should be a marketplace of ideas</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-me"><p>I agree and this is why I decided to stop talking to you</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-them"><p>
With the best ones succeeding and lesser ones failing.</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-me"><p>You have actually given me very little insight into your ideas</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-me"><p>You've only questioned mine in insulting ways</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-them"><p>
Well I would recommend that you start taking criticism of ideas- not you personally- better.</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-them"><p>
Also, I think you stereotype people terribly.</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-me"><p>If you can articulate how trump is going to improve the economy, increase wages for lower class, I'd be happy to listen</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-me"><p>If you're going to criticize how I take criticism (Lolololol) then clearly this isn't helpful to me</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-them"><p>
I'm a trump supporter and I've made passionate love to several very attractive transsexuals. So all of my criticism is warranted.</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-me"><p>Your criticism of what?</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-them"><p>
Your sophomoric political views and empty condescension</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-me"><p>How is it wrong? Criticism isn't just saying &quot;do it better&quot; or &quot;you didn't make sense&quot; it's offering information</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-me"><p>Using big words in your insults doesn't count as good criticism either hahaha</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-them"><p>
You're right. I'm totally wrong.</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-them"><p>
If you were hotter- I would explain, but you're not. And this is a waste of time.</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-me"><p>I wish you could explain how trump is going to increase wages for lower class. Or maybe point how how I was wrong about the subprime mortgage crisis.</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-me"><p>Jesus</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-me"><p>If I were hotter?</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-me"><p>I am not worth your time because I am not attractive physically enough?</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-them"><p>
The fact that you are so confident that you know what you are talking about is really scary</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-them"><p>
Like you have no self awareness?</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-me"><p>I could be the ugliest girl in the world and still be very much capable of having political ideas</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-me"><p>I don't see how attractiveness matters at all here</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-them"><p>
Yes but having low information and incorrect ones- the hotter you are, the more I can bear those political ideas 🙃</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-me"><p>Im sorry that you are scared.</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-me"><p>Again, I think after insisting that we talk and insulting me for avoiding you, you could explain how trump is going to increase wages for lower class. Or maybe point how how I was wrong about the subprime mortgage crisis.</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-them"><p>
You have no grasp of it</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-them"><p>
You literally have ZERO grasp of it</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-me"><p>If you're going to imply that I'm ugly, vapid, &quot;sophomoric&quot; etc without any real evidence I can't do very much to improve my opinions</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-me"><p>If you explained the mortgage crisis maybe that would help me</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-me"><p>Or if you told me how trump is going to improve the situation for working class Americans</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-them"><p>
That's like saying explain the Bible to me</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-me"><p>well thats what you asked of me &ldquo;Explain the subprime mortgage crisis to me please &ldquo;</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-them"><p>
I think you should start with reading about Hank Paulson and Ben bernanke and role the fed played. That's a start.</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-them"><p>
You just don't fucking know. You're a twerp know it all kid.</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-them"><p>
Just shut up.</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-me"><p>i have not ONCE insulted you</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-them"><p>
For fck sakes</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-them"><p>
I don't care. You need to be insulted.</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-them"><p>
If you need a safe space turn off your fckin phone</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-them"><p>
For fuck sakes</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-them"><p>
You are not smart. You are not successful. You are not even charming.</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-me"><p>I am sorry, I thought that you may lose your temper so I tried to avoid your advances after you admitted to being a trump supporter.</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-them"><p>
The one thing you are</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-them"><p>
Is dead fucking wrong.</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-them"><p>
About everything. Ever.</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-me"><p>I think safe spaces are great for people.</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-me"><p>perhaps you should also consider a safe space seeing as how upset you are.</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-them"><p>
Always assume you are dead fucking wrong.</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-them"><p>
I have a safe space. It's called the chamber of my glock 19.</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-me"><p>that sounds outwardly violent. safe spaces are not meant to intimidate or oppress outsiders</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-them"><p>
Ur safe space can lick my butt hole</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-me"><p>they are simple a place for like minded individuals to congregate free from unwanted harassment</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-them"><p>
Cool.</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-them"><p>
They sound like a place for losers</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-them"><p>
I'll be in the real world</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-them"><p>
Living</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-them"><p>
With the rest of the people doing shit so you fucktards can have a safe space</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-me"><p>I still have no idea why or how you support trump although you seemed quite sure that you were &ldquo;a proponent of a diversity of opinions&rdquo;</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-me"><p>I suppose all I'
m saying is that you haven'
t shared any political opinions with me</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-me"><p>You'
ve only insulted my appearance, my intelligence, and my own opinions</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-them"><p>
Soz</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-me"><p>well as a &ldquo;a proponent of a diversity of opinions&rdquo; I'
m assuming that means that you'
re also a proponent of sharing ideas to come to a deeper understanding</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-me"><p>You haven'
t shared any of  your ideas</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-them"><p>
I literally can't</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-me"><p>although i have gleaned that you think I'
m young and ugly</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-them"><p>
No. that you're not hot enough to care anymore</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-me"><p>you can'
t articulate your ideas because I'
m so ugly?</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-them"><p>
If you are ugly I would have swiped left</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-them"><p>
Look I don't care.</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-them"><p>
I'm not going to change your mind. It doesn't matter.</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-me"><p>Okay thats fine. Please don'
t contact me again.</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<div class="from-them"><p>
Literally put my balls in your mouth</p>
