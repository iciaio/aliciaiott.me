	<h1>Escape</h1>
	<p class="about">A virtual reality video game made for oculus.</p> 

	<p>This game mimics the repetition of everyday life. A player will walk through the same house multiple times. Each door leads back into the same house, but on each pass the house will be slightly different. For example a drawer that is usually closed and locked may be open to reveal a clue or a key. The goal is to end the repetition by leaving the house. To do so the player must find keys, open locks, or read letters, etc.</p>
