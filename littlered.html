         My main role in this project was planning the virtual city and creating assets (buildings/cars/lights/traffic cones...) for it. This game was a huge challenge for me and I spent several sleepless nights trying to make the city layout jive with the gameplay. I realized early on that because I was in charge of such a large asset, the best way to complete it was to make smaller, modular assets. I made buildings that could be reused with minimal effort. It is because of this that my partner and I were able to finish the game on time.
