	<h1>The Girls are Home (2016)</h1>
	<p class="about"><i>An interactive, augmented reality installation featuring a doll-house size replica of my childhood home.<i></p>
	    
	<p>This project was displayed at the <a href="http://artandcode.com/weirdreality/" target="_blank">2016 Weird Reality VR Symposium</a>. It was a collaborative work with Char Stiles.</p>

	<p>The Girls Are Home consists of a small dollhouse, inside of which are two smartphones. The phones are playing stereoscopic footage of Char and me in our home, cleaning, cooking, having guests over, etc. Viewers can look inside the windows (one eye in each window) to glimpse a day in our lives in stereo. The experience is playful and the scale of the house (and thus it's virtual inhabitants) transforms the viewer into a giant peeping tom.</p>
	
	<p class="about"><i>Concept</i></p>

	<p>This project emerged out of a desire to merge virtual reality (a digital, interactive experience) with a tactile, sculptural object. I had been exploring my own childhood memories and trying to make work that illicits nostalic feelings--something I hoped many people could relate to. This project, with Char's help, evolved to speak to a broader context than just my persoal childhood memories. Through this work we hoped to discuss feminity and domesticity in VR. For me this project affirms that AR and VR can be personal, quaint, nostalgic, feminine, and tactile and can exist outside of a headset.</p>
