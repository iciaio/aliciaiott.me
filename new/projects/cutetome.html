	<h1>Cute to Me 2015</h1>
	<p class="about">An experimental animated music video starring local pittsburgh drag artist, Moonbaby</p> 

	<p>I worked with David Gordon, Char Stiles, Kevin Ramser, and Guy DeBree to 3D-scan, motion-capture, and record in a panoptic dome the performances of Moonbaby. In post production we warped her virtual image to fantastically bucksome and impossibly slick, to a deformed 3d shape beyond reconition. The effects in this video were meant to exaggerate and distort the female form in order to comment on its usage in media and to question convential gender/beauty standards.</p>
