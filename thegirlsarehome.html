          <p class = "about">This is an interactive dollhouse in which the windows are lenses into a 3d recorded scene being played back on mobile phones within the house. I modeled the house from memory of my childhood home. Steroscopic footage is displayed behind the windows. The footage is a mundane represenation of domestic life shot in our own home. The viewer is placed into the story and given a role (as a giant, voyeuristic intruder) in this non-linear immersive storytelling device.</p>

          <p class = "about"> This piece was exhibited at <a href="http://artandcode.com/weirdreality/">WEIRD REALITY</a> (an Art and Code symposium) at Carnegie Mellon University.
